# Backend API Endpoints Expected by the Frontend

This document lists all REST API endpoints the PureTask frontend expects the backend to implement. Paths are relative to the API base URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`).

For Trust-Fintech integration details (auth, response contracts, roles, errors, CORS), see [TRUST_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md](./TRUST_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md).

**Implemented:** `GET /bookings/me` and `GET /cleaners/:cleanerId/reviews` return real data. See Bookings & Jobs and Cleaners below. Referral, job photos, cleaner schedule range, check-in optional fields, and admin resolve-dispute path are documented in their sections.

|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/config/job-status` | Optional. Returns `{ statuses: string[], terminal?: string[], transitions?: Record<string, string[]>, labels?: Record<string, string> }`.

## Job details & tracking (for animations)

The job-details UI (timeline rail, reliability ring, ledger flow, photos, presence) uses a **two-call pattern**:

1. **Static job details (once):** **GET /jobs/:jobId/details**  
   Returns in one payload: `job`, `cleaner` (incl. `reliability_score`, tier, avg_rating, jobs_completed), `photos`, `checkins`, `ledgerEntries`, `paymentIntent`, `payout`.  
   Response shape: `{ data: JobDetailsResponse }`. Frontend types: [JOB_DETAILS_API.md](./JOB_DETAILS_API.md) and `src/types/jobDetails.ts`. Paste-ready backend route + SQL: [BACKEND_JOB_DETAILS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./BACKEND_JOB_DETAILS_IMPLEMENTATION.md).  
   **Backend must:** protect with `requireOwnership("job", "jobId")` to prevent leaks.

2. **Live presence (polling):** **GET /tracking/:jobId**  
   Returns job tracking state: timeline events + **current cleaner location** from latest `cleaner.location_updated` event.  
   Frontend polls every 5–10s (or uses websockets later) to update approach dot and status transitions.

**Required backend fields for animations** (already in DB): job (id, status, scheduled/actual times, address, lat/lng, cleaner_id, credit_amount, cleaning_type); cleaner (reliability_score, tier, avg_rating, jobs_completed); credit_ledger (delta_credits, reason, created_at); payment_intents (status, amount_cents, etc.); payouts (status, amount_cents, updated_at); job_checkins or tracking events for presence.

**Best practice:** Keep live GPS/presence out of `/jobs/:jobId/details`. Use `/jobs/:jobId/details` for static-ish UI data and `/tracking/:jobId` for live presence.

**UI → data reference:** Component-to-data-to-DB-to-API mapping and fallbacks: [PURETASK_INTERACTIVE_UI_DATA_GUIDE.md](./PURETASK_INTERACTIVE_UI_DATA_GUIDE.md).

---

## Notes

- **Base URL**: Configure via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.
- **Auth**: Most endpoints expect `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Trust API** uses paths prefixed with `/api/` (credits, billing, appointments); the main app uses paths without that prefix.
- **Path conventions**: Some services may expect different shapes; this list reflects current frontend usage.
- **Gamification**: Full request/response shapes and data model: [GAMIFICATION_BACKEND_SPEC.md](./GAMIFICATION_BACKEND_SPEC.md) (or GAMIFICATION_BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md).
- **Recently implemented (backend):** `GET /bookings/me` (real client bookings), `GET /cleaners/:id/reviews` (paginated reviews), `POST /admin/jobs/:jobId/resolve-dispute`, `POST /referral/send`, `GET /referral/me`, `POST /jobs/:jobId/photos`, `GET /cleaner/schedule?from=&to=`, and check-in body optional `accuracyM`, `source`. Trust live checklist returns `id`, `completed`, `completedAtISO` (labels on frontend). See DECISIONS.md for data ownership (labels/copy).

**Frontend wiring (this repo):** Optional GET /config/job-status is wired: `src/services/config.service.ts` (`getJobStatusConfig`), `src/hooks/useJobStatusConfig.ts` (status/transition logic with fallback to `src/constants/jobStatus.ts`). Config (optional) is documented above; [FRONTEND_QA_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md](./FRONTEND_QA_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md) Product/alignment mentions this and `useJobStatusConfig`.

---

## Endpoints still returning stubs or placeholder data

These routes exist for frontend compatibility but return empty/hardcoded data or no-op success. Replace with real implementations when the feature is needed.

**Implemented with real data:**

- **GET /cleaners/:id/availability** — Uses `getWeeklyAvailability(cleanerId)`; returns `slots` from `cleaner_availability`.
- **GET /cleaners/top-rated** and **GET /cleaners/featured** — Query cleaners with rating/review count from `reviews`; featured reuses top-rated (no featured flag on cleaners).
- **GET /admin/risk/review** — `getRiskReviewQueue()` queries `risk_flags` where `active = true`, returns users + flags and a simple risk score from severity.
- **GET /notifications** and **GET /notifications/unread-count** — Feed from `notification_log` for current user; unread_count is total count (no `read_at` column yet; PATCH read / POST read-all remain no-op until schema added).

| Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| GET | `/cleaners/featured` | **Real data** | Same as top-rated (no featured flag). |
| GET | `/cleaners/top-rated` | **Real data** | From `reviews` + cleaner_profiles; ordered by rating. |
| GET | `/cleaners/:id/availability` | **Real data** | From `getWeeklyAvailability` / `cleaner_availability`. |
| GET | `/notifications` | **Real data** | From `notification_log` for user; no read state yet. |
| GET | `/notifications/unread-count` | **Real data** | Total count from `notification_log`. |
| PATCH | `/notifications/:id/read` | No-op | Add `read_at` column to persist. |
| POST | `/notifications/read-all` | No-op | Same. |
| GET | `/client/payment-methods` | Stub | Needs Stripe `paymentMethods.list`. |
| POST | `/users/me/avatar` | 501 | Upload or redirect. |
| POST | `/client/profile/photo` | Body only | Add file upload. |
| GET | `/admin/risk/review` | **Real data** | `getRiskReviewQueue()` queries `risk_flags`. |

**Other notes:**

- **Search** (`/search/global`, `/search/autocomplete`): Return empty when query &lt; 2 chars; otherwise use DB. Not stubs.
- **Holidays**: Returns real data from `listHolidays()`; empty only on error (fallback).
- **Gamification** (e.g. next-best-actions, badges): When `gamification_enabled` is false, returns empty by design.
