## Notes

- **Base URL**: Configure via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.
- **Auth**: Most endpoints expect `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Trust API** uses paths prefixed with `/api/` (credits, billing, appointments); the main app uses paths without that prefix.
- **Path conventions**: Some services may expect different shapes; this list reflects current frontend usage.
