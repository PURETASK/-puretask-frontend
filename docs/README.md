### Quick Reference

- **Goal:** Users believe "They verify the work happened," "If something goes wrong, it's traceable," and "My money/credits are accounted for."
- **Approach:** Radix/shadcn + Framer Motion (limited), incremental migration, drawer-first detail views.
- **Phase 1 scope:** 3 existing pages + 3 new pages; no big-bang rewrite.
